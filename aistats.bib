  abstract =	 {This paper synthesizes ideas from the fields of graphical modelling and eductational testing, particularly Item Response Theory (IRT) applied to Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT). Graphical modelling can offer IRT a language for describing multifaceted skills and knowledge and disentangling evidence from com- plex performances. IRT-CA T can offer graphical modellers several ways of treating sources of variability other than including more variables in the model. In particular, variables can enter into the modelling pro- cess at several levels: (1) in validity studies (but not in the ordinarily used model), (2) in task construction (in particular, in defining link parameters), (3) in test or model assembly (blocking and randomization con- straints in selecting tasks or other model pieces), (4) in response characterization (i.e. as part of task models which characterize a response) or (5) in the main (student) model. The paper describes an implementation of these ideas in a fielded application: HYDRIVE, a tutor for hydraulics diagnosis},

Previous studies have shown minimum message length (MML) estimation to perform well in a wide variety of mixture modelling problems, including determining the number of com- ponents which best describes some data. In this paper, we focus on the difficult problem of overlapping components.
An advantage of the probabilistic mixture modelling approach is its ability to identify models where the components overlap and data items can belong prob- abilistically to more than one component. Significantly overlapping distributions require more data for their parameters to be accurately estimated than well sep- arated distributions. For example, two Gaussian distributions are considered to significantly overlap when their means are within three standard deviations of each other. If insufficient data is available, only a single component distribution will be estimated, although the data originates from two component distributions.
In this paper, we quantify this difficulty in terms of the number of data items needed for the MML criterion to 'discover' two overlapping components. First, we perform experiments which compare the MML criterion's performance relative to other Bayesian criteria based on MCMC sampling. Second, we make two alterations to the existing MML estimates in order to improve its performance on overlapping distributions. Experiments are performed with the new estimates to confirm that they are effective.},

Recent research in this area has fo- cussed on utilising language context to improve recognition performance, without taking the information from the input signal itself into proper account. In this paper, we adopt a Bayesian approach to solving this problem. The Bayesian framework allows us to integrate signal-level information from the actual input with the linguistic context usually used in post-processing the recogniser's output. We demonstrate the validity of a statistical approach to integrating these two sources of information. We also analyse the need for improvement in performance through innovative estimation of informative priors, and describe our method for obtaining agreement from multiple experts for this task. We compare the performance of our integrated signal-language model against existing "language-only" models.},

The forward Monte Carlo sampling technique draws independent and identically distributed observations. Methods that have been proposed in this spirit sample from the entire distribution. However, when the number of variables is large, the state space of all variables is exponentially large, and the sample size required for good estimates is too large to be practical. In the forward Monte Carlo method we generate observations from a subset of chance variables for each decision node in the influence diagram. We use methods developed for exact solution of influence diagrams to limit the number of chance variables sampled at any time. Because influence diagrams model each chance variable with a conditional probability distribution, the forward Monte Carlo solution method lends itself very well to influence-diagram representations.},

The construction process is based on the computation of mutual information and cross entropy of attribute pairs. This algorithm guarantees that the \emph{minimal Independent map} [1] of the underlying dependency model is generated, and at the same time, enjoys the time complexity of $O(N^2)$ on conditional independence (Cl) tests. To evaluate this algorithm, we present the experimental results on three versions of the well-known ALARM network database, which has 37 attributes and 10,000 records. The correctness proof and the analysis of computational complexity are also presented. We also discuss the features ofour work and relate it to previous works.},

In effect, the algorithm performs a stochastic search for promising trees. Examples are used to illustrate the potential superiority of this approach over conventional greedy methods.},

This paper examines classical problems of valid causal inference in observational studies, using epidemiological studies on the association between exposure to diesel exhaust (DE) and risk of lung cancer as a case study. It shows that one of the main applied computational tools of AI and statistics, classification tree analysis, can be adapted to help control or avoid many of the usual statistical threats to valid causal inference, and links this new use of classification trees to an established older literature on techniques for causal inference in social statistics based on elimination of competing (non-causal) explanations for observed associations. A strong link is then forged between an extension of classification tree analysis and modem AI and statistics approaches to causal modeling and inference based in directed acyclic graph (DAG) causal models and influence diagrams. This new link is based on the observation that classification tree analysis can be adapted to test the local Markov conditions that provide the critical defining structure of DAG models, as well as to quantify the conditional distributions of variables given the values of their parents - the key numerical information needed to quantify an influence diagram model. Finally, these insights are applied to available data on DE and lung cancer risks and are used to conclude that there is no evidence of a causal relation between them.},

Specifically, we introduce a new model of noise called \emph{constant-partition classification noise} (CPCN) which generalizes the standard model of classification noise to allow different examples to have different rates of random misclassification. One example of CPCN type noise is data with differing rates of false positives and false negatives. We then show how to learn in the presense of CPCN for any concept class learnable by statistical queries. This set of classes includes every concept class known to be learnable in the presense of standard classification noise. Our model is the first such non-uniform generalization of the standard classification noise model that allows efficient learning of this wide range of concept classes.
  
We then examine standard methods of decision tree induction in the context of noisy data. We observe that the core of commonly used algorithms such as ID3, CART and c4.5 are not robust to CPCN noise, or even to standard classification noise. We therefore propose a simple modification to these algorithms in order to make them robust against CPCN. The modification is based on the statistical query techniques for CPCN described above.},

It can reduce error by accounting for model uncertainty in a principled way, and its usefulness in several areas has been empirically verified. However, few attempts to apply it to rule induction have been made. This paper reports a series of experiments designed to test the utility of BMA in this field. BMA is applied to combining multiple rule sets learned from different subsets of the training data, to combining multiple rules covering a test example, to inducing technical rules for foreign exchange trading, and to inducing conjunctive concepts. In the first two cases, BMA is observed to produce lower accuracies than the ad hoc methods it is compared with. In the last two cases, BMA is observed to typically produce the same result as simply using the best (maximum-likelihood) rule, even though averaging is performed over all possible rules in the space, the domains are highly noisy, and the samples are medium- to small-sized. In all cases, this is observed to be due to BMA's consistent tendency to assign highly asymmetric weights to different models, even when their accuracy differs by little, with most models (often all but one) effectively having no influence on the outcome. Thus the effective number of models being averaged is much smaller for BMA than for common ad hoc methods, leading to a smaller reduction in variance. This suggests that the success of the multiple models approach to rule induction is primarily due to this variance reduction, and not to its being a closer approximation to the Bayesian ideal.},

For example, in telecommunications industry repeatedly decisions are made every day for fraud detection and account treatment. Indicators (variables) that have large uncertainties are used to make these decisions. Furthermore, the consequences of such decisions are recorded for later analysis. Similarly, in the financial industry, stocks or currencies are traded based on some indicators (variables). The consequences of these trade can be found. Similarly in the medicine, the patient treatment decisions are made on the basis of the patient information, and the consequences of these decisions to the patients can be found. These data sets contain uncertain variables, decision variables, and value lottery (final outcomes). Furthermore these decisions may not be made not by a single decision maker, but by many decision makers. In contrast to a typical decision analysis, in these environments decisions are made repeatedly. This paper addresses the discovery of knowledge bearing on these decisions in the form of influence diagrams (normative decision models) using a novel supervised machine learning method that constructs Bayesian network models with decisions. Algorithms presented in this paper exploit the goal oriented characteristics o f influence diagrams and generate a specific form of influence diagrams that are efficient, both to learn and evaluate. For this reason they are called "efficient" influence diagrams.},

Probabilistic concept trees are a target structure for a number of clustering systems from machine learning such as COBWEB (Fisher, 1987) and systems by Hadzikadik and Yun (1989), Gennari, Langley, and Fisher (1989), Decaestecker (1991), Anderson and Matessa (1991), Reich and Fenves (1991), Biswas, Weinberg, and Li (1994), De Alte Da Veiga (1994), Kilander (1994) Ketterlin, Gan{\c}arski, and Korczak (1995), and Nevins (1995). Related probabilistic structures are produced by systems such as AUTOCLASS (Cheeseman, Kelly, Self, Stutz, Taylor, &Freeman, 1988), SNOB (Wallace &Boulton, 1968; Wallace & Dowe, 1994) , and systems by Hanson and Bauer (1989) and Martin and Billman (1994). These systems can be easily adapted to form probabilistic concept trees of the type we describe. This paper will not focus on clustering systems \emph{per se}, but on characteristics and capabilities of probabilistic concept trees, particularly as they relate to inference tasks often associated with belief networks. As 'object-centered' knowledge structures, probabilistic concept trees nicely complement the 'variable-centered', belief network structure.},

Among the contributions of this new paradigm are the computational sciences, which involve the study of computer simulations rather than physical systems. This transition to a simulated world carries with it an important scientific advantage: the opportunity to run experiments that are expensive, dangerous, or impossible in the real world. Unfortunately, such experiments are often too easy, and the scientist is overwhelmed with empirical data.
  
  The fields of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Statistics are concerned with modelling and analyzing such large bodies of data. AI employs heuristic reasoning and knowledge to select potential models, and statistical analysis verifies a proposed model. The combinatio~ of knowledge-based, heuristic, and statistical techniques is quite successful at modelling experiment data (e.g. [11]).
  
Our goal is to provide an intelligent, integrated environment for scientific modelling, experimentation , and analysis, called the Scientist 's Empirical Assistant (SEA). SEA is an assistant to human scientists: it automates model generation and verification, experiment design and data collection, but also relies on a human user for guidance, domain knowledge, and decision-making. SEA designs and runs prospective experiments with a simulator, allowing it to draw stronger conclusions than with post-hoc data analysis alone.

SEA employs a variety of techniques from both AI and Statistics. It uses heuristic and knowledge-based reasoning to propose models, design experiments, and select analyses. It applies statistical techniques to verify models against experiment data. It develops plans to direct its course of action, and learns which plans are most successful based on past experience. Finally, it models the knowledge of the user to ensure its suggestions and decisions are appropriate.},

The predictive distributions are expressed in terms of a finite number observables based on a given set of binary vectors (predictors or centroids) representing a system of classes and an entropy-maximizing family of probability distributions. We derive the (non-probabilistic) criterion of maximal predictive classification due to J . Gower (1974) as a special case of a Bayesian predictive classification. The notion of a predictive distribution will be related to stochastic complexity of a set of data with respect to a family of statistical distributions. An application to bacterial identification will be presented using a database of Enterobacteriaceae as in Gyllenberg (1996 c).

A framework for the analysis is provided by a theorem about the merging of opinions due to Blackwell and Dubins (1962). We prove certain results about the asymptotic properties of the predictive learning process.},

  abstract =	 {The last few years have witnessed a resurgence of research effort aimed at developing improved techniques for supervised classification problems. In a large part this resurgence of interest has been stimulated by the novelty of multi-layer feedforward neural networks (Hertz et al, 1991; Ripley, 1996) and similar complex and flexible models such as MARS (Friedman, 1991), projection pursuit regression (Friedman and Stuetzle, 1981), and additive models in general (Hastie and Tibshirani, 1990)). The flexibility of these models is in striking contrast to the simplicity of models such as simple linear discriminant analysis, perceptrons, and logistic discriminant analysis, which assume highly restricted forms of decision surface.

The merit of the flexibility of neural networks is countered by the dangers that they will overfit the design data. This relationship between model flexibility and the danger of overfitting has long been understood within the statistical community. For example, in the 1960s the optimistic bias of resubstitution error rate became widely recognised and it was replaced by the leave-one-out method as the method of choice. (Later, in the 1980s, an apparently large variance of the latter led to its being abandoned in favour of bootstrap methods, in particular the 632 bootstrap.) Early work on neural networks also fell into this trap, producing inflated claims of the performance of such models .derived from optimistic performance measures based on overfitting the design set. In recent years the risk has been recognised, and some sophisticated proposals have been made for overcoming the problem. They are based on ideas such as penalising the goodness of fit measure (by combining it with a measure of model complexity), restricting the form of the model (to few nodes in a network, for example), shrinking an overfitted model .(by weight decay, for example), or even by adding randomly perturbed replicates to the design set. The problem with all such methods is \emph{how} to strike the optimum compromise between modelling the design data and overfitting.},

However, due to non uniqueness of a global minimum and the existence of (possibly) many local minima, the model revealed by the network is non stable. We introduce a method to interpret neural network results which uses novel robustification techniques. This results in a robust interpretation of the model employed by the network. Simulated data from known models is used to demonstrate the interpretability results and to demonstrate the effects of different regularization methods on the robustness of the model. Graphical methods are introduced to present the interpretation results. We further demonstrate how interaction between covariates can be revealed. From this study we conclude that the interpretation method works well, but that NN models may sometimes be misinterpreted, especially if the approximations to the true model are less robust.},

An often-used approximation for this estimate is obtained by selecting a single model structure and averaging over its parameters. The approximation is useful because it is computationally efficient, and because it provides a model that facilitates understanding· of the domain. A common criterion for model selection is the posterior probability of the model. Another criterion for model selection, proposed by San Martini and Spezzafari (1984) , is the predictive performance of a model for the next observation to be seen. From the standpoint of domain understanding, both criteria are useful, because one identifies the model that is most likely, whereas the other identifies the model that is the best predictor of the next observation. To highlight the difference, we refer to the posterior-probability and alternative criteria as the \emph{scientific criterion} (SC) and \emph{engineering criterion} (EC), respectively. When we are interested in predicting the next observation, the model-averaged estimate is at least as good as that produced by EC, which itself is at least as good as the estimate produced by SC. We show experimentally that, for Bayesian-network models containing discrete variables only, differences in predictive performance between the model-averaged estimate and EC and between EC and SC can be substantial.},

Overfitted models contain unnecessary structure that reflects nothing more than random variation in the data sample used to construct the model. Portions of these models are literally wrong, and can mislead users. Overfitted models are less efficient to store and use than their correctly-sized counterparts. Finally, overfitting can reduce the accuracy of induced models on new data [14, 7].
  
  For induction algorithms that build decision trees [1, 13, 15], pruning is a common approach to correct overfitting. Pruning techniques take an induced tree, examine individual subtrees, and remove those subtrees deemed to be unnecessary. While pruning techniques can differ in several respects, they primarily differ in the criterion used to judge subtrees. Many criteria have been proposed, including statistical significance tests [13], corrected error estimates [15], and minimum description length calculations [12].
  
  Most common pruning techniques, however, do not account for one potentially important factor - multiple testing. Multiple testing occurs whenever an induction algorithm examines several candidate models and selects the one that best accords with the data. Any search process necessarily involves multiple testing, and most common induction algorithms involve implicit or explicit search through a space of candidate models. In the case of decision trees, search involves examining many possible subtrees and selecting the best one. Pruning techniques need to account for the number of subtrees examined, because such multiple testing affects the apparent accuracy of models on training data [8].
  
This paper examines the importance of adjusting for multiple testing. Specifically, it examines the effectiveness of one particular pruning method - \emph{bonferroni pruning}. Bonferroni pruning adjusts the results of a standard significance test to account for the number of subtrees examined at a particular node of a decision tree. Evidence that bonferroni pruning leads to better models supports the hypothesis that multiple testing is an important cause of overfitting.},

We consider three approaches for computing this predictive distribution, and assume that the joint probability distribution for the variables belongs to a set of distributions determined by a set of parametric models.

In the simplest case, the predictive distribution is computed by using the model with the \emph{maximum a posteriori (MAP)} posterior probability. In the \emph{evidence} approach, the predictive distribution is obtained by averaging over all the individual models.in the model family. In the third case, we define the predictive distribution by using Rissanen's new definition of \emph{stochastic complexity}. Our experiments performed with the family of Naive Bayes models suggest that when using all the data available, the stochastic complexity approach produces the most accurate predictions in the log-score sense. However, when the amount of available training data is decreased, the evidence approach clearly outperforms the two other approaches. The MAP predictive distribution is clearly inferior in the log-score sense to the two more sophisticated approaches, but for the 0/1-score the MAP approach may still in some cases produce the best results.},

  Focusing the discussion on partially observed domains, it is important to design algorithms which provide probability distributions over the current and future states of the non-observable components of the domain, using the information stored in the observable components.
  
In this paper, we present a simulation algorithm for approximating the exact probability distributions associated with such inference and forecast processes. This algorithm uses both the probabilities built at the previous time step and the new evidence obtained to propose new probability distributions associated with current and future states of the domain. To validate the algorithm, a case study of equipment maintenance is considered.},

A similarity measure, proposed by Goodall for biological taxonomy[13], that gives greater weight to uncommon feature-value matches in similarity computations and makes no assumptions of the underlying distributions of the feature-values, is adopted to define the similarity measure between pairs of objects. An agglomerative algorithm is employed to construct a concept tree, and a simple distinctness heuristic is used to extract a partition of the data. The performance of SBAC has been studied on artificially generated data sets. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of this algorithm in unsupervised discovery tasks.

The challenge of this problem is to decide which models to rely on for prediction and how much weight to give each.
  
  The goal of combining learned models is to obtain a more accurate predic- tion than can be obtained from any single source alone. One major issue in combining a set of learned models is redundancy. Redundancy refers to the amount of agreement or linear dependence between models when making a set of predictions~ The more the set agrees, the more redundancy is present. In statistical terms, this is referred to as the multicollinearity problem.
  
The focus of this paper is to describe and evaluate an approach for combining regression estimates based on principal components regression. The method, called PCR*, is then evaluated on several real-world domains to demonstrate its robustness versus a collection of existing techniques.},

This implies that decreases in tree size obtained by more sophisticated data reduction techniques should be decomposed into two parts: that which is due to reduction of training set size, and the remainder, which is due to how the method selects instances to discard. We perform this decomposition for one recent data reduction technique, John's ROBUST-c4.5 (John 1995), and show that a large percentage of its effect on tree size is attributable to the fact that it simply reduces the size of the training set. We conclude that random data reduction is a baseline against which more sophisticated data reduction techniques should be compared.},

  In section 1 I will survey a number of extensions of the DAG framework based on directed graphs and chain graphs (Lauritzen and Wermuth 1989; Frydenberg 1990; Koster 1996; Andersson, Madigan and Perlman 1996). Those based on directed graphs include models based on directed cyclic and acyclic graphs, possibly including latent variables and/or selection bias (Pearl, 1988; Spirtes, Glymour and Scheines 1993; Spirtes 1995; Spirtes, Meek, and Richardson 1995; Richardson 1996a, 1996b; Koster 1996; Pearl and Dechter 1996; Cox and Wermuth, 1996).
  
In section 2 I state two properties, motivated by causal and spatial intuitions, that the set of conditional independencies entailed by a graphical model might satisfy. I proceed to show that the sets of independencies entailed by (i) an undirected graph via separation, and (ii) a (cyclic or acyclic) directed graph (possibly with latent and/or selection variables) via ct-separation, satisfy both properties. By contrast neither of these properties, in general, will hold in a chain graph under the Lauritzen-Wermuth-Frydenberg (LWF) interpretation. One property holds for chain graphs under the Andersson-Madigan-Perlman (AMP) interpretation, the other does not. The examination of these properties and others like them may provide insight into the current vigorous debate concerning the applicability of chain graphs under different global Markov properties.},

(Pearl 1988, Lauritzen et al. 1990). In much the same spirit, directed cyclic graphs (DCGs) have been introduced to represent the causal ·structure of feedback processes and the restrictions on probability distributions those structures imply.

In order to compare predictive accuracy when the training data are complete vs. incomplete/imputed, we use only complete cases from a natural data set, but artificially remove 80\% of their input data values. Very little difference is observed in the comparison, suggesting that the mixture model is quite effective here, despite the fact that more than 99\% of the casesfmstances had had some missing value(s). The mixture model can be used both for output/outcome prediction by a trained MLP and for the training process itself.

To address this problem, research into combining classifiers has increased significantly in the last few years (Breiman 1992; Wolpert 1992; Breiman 1994). These methods are of two basic types: concatenation uses the output from one classifier as input to the next classifier; parallel classifiers work on the same input data with the output from each classifier combined using regression or vote-counting techniques (Schurman 1996). These strategies greatly improve the predictive power of unstable classifiers.
  
However, when the goal of the statistical analysis is to learn about the relationship between outcome and predictors, these strategies for combining classifiers are unacceptable since they produce a large number of trees, making interpretation difficult. We present a new method for combining classification trees which results in a single, interpretable tree. We begin by defining a distance metric between two trees based on the amount of rearrangement needed so that the structure of the two trees is identical. Using this distance metric, we develop the concept of the central, or median, tree structure and estimate it using a consensus rule. This tree is seen to be more centrally located than the tree fit to all the data. We finish by discussing future work including alternative methods for estimating the median tree, probability models, uses in data mining and meta-analysis, and performance measurements of the median tree.},

  Cross-validation is less seldomly used in \emph{unsupervised} learning such as clustering. It is popular in kernel density estimation for choosing the smoothing parameter (the kernel bandwidth). However, it does not appear to have been used for the problem of determining cluster structure in clustering problems, i.e., solving the problem of how many clusters to fit to a given data set. This is the problem addressed in this paper.
  
Cross-validated likelihood can be viewed as an appropriate metric for model selection in probabilistic clustering, in particular for finite mixture models. In this paper, the use of cross-validated likelihood for clustering is investigated a.nd the method is applied to a real problem where "truth" is unknown, i.e., determining the number of intrinsic "regimes" in records of upper atmosphere pressure taken daily since 1948 over the Northern Hemisphere.},

  abstract =	 {Since 1993 we have been working on a system to help people with exploratory data analysis (EDA). AIDE, an Assistant for Intelligent Data Exploration, is a knowledge-based planning system that incrementally explores a dataset, guided by user directives and its own evaluation of indications in the data. Its plan library contains strategies for generating and interpreting indications in data, selecting techniques to build appropriate descriptions of data, carrying out relevant procedures, and combining individual results into a coherent larger picture. The system is mixed-initiative, autonomously pursuing high- and low-level goals while still allowing the user to inform or override its decisions.
  
  Elsewhere we have described AIDE's operations and primitive data structures [22), its planning representation [23], its user interface [25, 24), and the system as a whole [21). This progress report discusses a recent evaluation we conducted with AIDE and explains why we believe that this line of research is important to AI and statistics researchers.
  
We will begin with a very brief overview of the system. The bulk of the paper describes the evaluation, our analysis of the results, and the lessons we learned through the experience of building and evaluating AIDE. We end with a discussion of the generality of our results and the potential for future work.},

  abstract =	 {We consider model selection based on information criteria for classification. The information criterion is expressed in the form of the empirical entropy plus a compensation term $(k(g)/2)d(n)$, where $k(g)$ is the number of independent parameters in a model $g$, $d(n)$ is a function of $n$, and $n$ is the number of examples. First of all, we derive for arbitrary $d(\cdot)$ the asymptotically exact error probabilities in model selection. Although it was known for linear/autoregression processes that $d(n) = \log \log n$ is the minimum function of n such that the model selection satisfies strong consistency, the problem whether the same thing holds for classification has been open. We solve this problem affirmatively. Additionally, we derive for arbitrary $d(\cdot)$ the expected Kullback-leibler divergence between a true conditional probability and the conditional probability estimated by the model selection and the Laplace estimators. The derived value is $k(g^*)/(2n)$, where $g^*$ is a true model, and the accumulated value over $n$ time instances is $(k(g*)/2) \log n + 0(1)$, which implies the optimality of a predictive coding based on the model selection. Keywords: model selection, error probability, strong con- sistency, Kullback-Leibler divergence, minimum description length principle, Hannan/Quinn's procedure, unseparated/separated models, Kolmogorov's law of the iterated logarithm.},

The first examines ways o f updating the classification rule as suggested by some monitoring process (similar to those used in a quality control problem), and this is applied to linear, logistic and quadratic discriminant. The second approach examines nonparametric classifiers based explicitly on the data and ways in which the data can be dynamically adapted to improve the performance. These methods are tried out on simulated data and real data from the credit industry.},

  abstract =	 {Minimum Message Length (MML) is an invariant Bayesian point estimation technique which is also consistent and efficient. We provide a brief overview of MML inductive inference (Wallace and Boulton (1968) , Wallace and Freeman (1987)), and how it has both an information-theoretic and a Bayesian interpretation. We then outline how MML is used for statistical parameter estimation, and how the MML mixture modelling program, Snob (Wallace and Boulton (1968), Wallace (1986), Wallace and Dowe (1994)) uses the message lengths from various parameter estimates to enable it to combine parameter estimation with selection of the num- ber of components. The message length is (to within a constant) the logarithm of the posterior probability of the theory. So, the MML theory can also be re- garded as the theory with the highest posterior probability. Snob currently assumes that variables are uncorrelated, and permits multi-variate data from Gaussian, discrete multi-state, Poisson and von Mises circular distributions.},

  abstract =	 {The GBI (graph-based induction) concept learning method is applied to extract typical access patterns of WWW data. By interpreting extracted patterns as the cache site layout we can reduce the total network data flow by implementing a distributed cache system which is adapted to the WWW access patterns. Although the huge WWW data flow causes the overflow of the conventional hierarchical cache system, the layout created by the GBI method eases this problem. The traffic reduction ratio of this distributed cache system is 2.5 times higher than that of the conventional hierarchical cache system. Our results suggest the importance of the data analyzing methods which can handle structured data. By analyzing regularity in graph structures, the GBI method can reduce the network data flow; The statistical criteria contribute to the analysis of promising patterns},
