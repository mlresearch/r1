title: Applying a Gaussian-Bernoulli Mixture Model Network to Binary and Continuous
  Missing Data in Medicine
abstract: 'We wish to train a feedforward projective-sigmoidal neural network (MLP)
  on breast cancer outcomes data missing both binary and continuous input variable
  values. A Gaussian-Bernoulli mixture model is trained on the data (using EM). It
  then performs stochastic imputation (filling in) of the missing values, as a preprocessor
  to the MLP. In order to compare predictive accuracy when the training data are complete
  vs. incomplete/imputed, we use only complete cases from a natural data set, but
  artificially remove 80% of their input data values. Very little difference is observed
  in the comparison, suggesting that the mixture model is quite effective here, despite
  the fact that more than 99% of the casesfmstances had had some missing value(s).
  The mixture model can be used both for output/outcome prediction by a trained MLP
  and for the training process itself. '
