title: Variational Inference for continuous Sigmoidal Bayesian Networks
abstract: Latent random variables can be useful for modelling covariance relationships
  between observed variables. The choice of whether specific latent variables ought
  to be continuous or discrete is often an arbitrary one. In a previous paper, I presented
  a "unit" that could adapt to be continuous or binary, as appropriate for the current
  problem, and showed how a Markov chain Monte Carlo method could be used for inference
  and parameter estimation in Bayesian networks of these units. In this paper, I develop
  a variational inference technique in the hope that it will prove to be more computationally
  efficient than Monte Carlo methods. After presenting promising \emph{inference}
  results on a toy problem, I discuss why the variational technique does not work
  well for \emph{parameter estimation} as compared to Monte Carlo.
