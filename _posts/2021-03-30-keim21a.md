title: 'Bayesian Information Retrieval: Preliminary Evaluation'
abstract: Given a database of documents and a user’s query, how can we locate those
  documents that meet the user’s information needs? Because there is no precise definition
  of which documents in the database match the user’s query, uncertainty is inherent
  in the information retrieval process. Therefore, probability theory is a natural
  tool for formalizing the retrieval task. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian approach
  to one of the conventional probabilistic information retrieval models. We discuss
  the motivation for such a model, describe its implementation, and present some experimental
  results.
