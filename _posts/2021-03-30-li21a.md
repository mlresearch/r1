title: Conceptual Clustering with Numeric-and-Nominal Mixed Data - A New Similarity
  Based System
abstract: This paper presents a new Similarity Based Agglomerative Clustering (SBAC)
  algorithm that works well for data with mixed numeric and nominal features. A similarity
  measure, proposed by Goodall for biological taxonomy[13], that gives greater weight
  to uncommon feature-value matches in similarity computations and makes no assumptions
  of the underlying distributions of the feature-values, is adopted to define the
  similarity measure between pairs of objects. An agglomerative algorithm is employed
  to construct a concept tree, and a simple distinctness heuristic is used to extract
  a partition of the data. The performance of SBAC has been studied on artificially
  generated data sets. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of this algorithm in
  unsupervised discovery tasks. Comparisons with other schemes illustrate the superior
  performance of the algorithm.
