title: A Comparison of Scientific and Engineering Criteria for Bayesian Model Selection
abstract: Given a set of possible model structures for variables $\mathbf{X}$ and
  a set of possible parameters for each structure, the Bayesian "estimate" of the
  probability distribution for $\mathbf{X}$ given observed data is obtained by averaging
  over the possible model structures and their parameters. An often-used approximation
  for this estimate is obtained by selecting a single model structure and averaging
  over its parameters. The approximation is useful because it is computationally efficient,
  and because it provides a model that facilitates understandingÂ· of the domain. A
  common criterion for model selection is the posterior probability of the model.
  Another criterion for model selection, proposed by San Martini and Spezzafari (1984)
  , is the predictive performance of a model for the next observation to be seen.
  From the standpoint of domain understanding, both criteria are useful, because one
  identifies the model that is most likely, whereas the other identifies the model
  that is the best predictor of the next observation. To highlight the difference,
  we refer to the posterior-probability and alternative criteria as the \emph{scientific
  criterion} (SC) and \emph{engineering criterion} (EC), respectively. When we are
  interested in predicting the next observation, the model-averaged estimate is at
  least as good as that produced by EC, which itself is at least as good as the estimate
  produced by SC. We show experimentally that, for Bayesian-network models containing
  discrete variables only, differences in predictive performance between the model-averaged
  estimate and EC and between EC and SC can be substantial.
