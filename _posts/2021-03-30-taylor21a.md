title: Statistical Aspects of Classification in Drifting Populations
abstract: This paper discusses ideas for adaptive learning which can capture dynamic
  aspects of real-world datasets. Broadly, we explore two approaches. The first examines
  ways o f updating the classification rule as suggested by some monitoring process
  (similar to those used in a quality control problem), and this is applied to linear,
  logistic and quadratic discriminant. The second approach examines nonparametric
  classifiers based explicitly on the data and ways in which the data can be dynamically
  adapted to improve the performance. These methods are tried out on simulated data
  and real data from the credit industry.
