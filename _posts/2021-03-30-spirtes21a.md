title: Heuristic Greedy Search Algorithms for Latent Variable Models
abstract: 'There has recently been significant progress in the development of algorithms
  for learning the directed acyclic graph (DAG) part of a Bayesian network without
  latent variables from data and optional background knowledge. However, the problem
  of learning the DAG part of a Bayesian network with latent (unmeasured) variables
  is much more difficult for two reasons: first the number of possible models is infinite,
  and second, calculating scores for latent variables models is generally much slower
  than calculating scores for models without latent variables. In this paper we will
  describe how to extend search algorithms developed for non-latent variable DAG models
  to the case of DAG models with latent variables. We will introduce two generalizations
  of DAGs, called mixed ancestor graphs (or MAGs) and partial ancestor graphs (or
  PAGs), and briefly describe how they can be used to search for latent variable DAG
  models, to classify, and to predict the effects of interventions in causal systems.'
