title: A Note on Cyclic Graphs and Dynamical Feedback Systems
abstract: 'Directed acyclic graphical (DAG) models were motivated in large part by
  the desire to have a general formalism to represent causal hypotheses and the restrictions
  on probability distributions they imply. DAG models exploited a fundamental kinship
  in a variety of statistical formalisms often treated as distinct "models": factor
  models, structural equation models, regression models, logistic regression models,
  survival models, etc. The fundamental connection is through either of two equivalent
  (for DAGs) properties, a "local" Markov condition, or the property of d-separation,
  sometimes called the "global" Markov condition. (Pearl 1988, Lauritzen et al. 1990).
  In much the same spirit, directed cyclic graphs (DCGs) have been introduced to represent
  the causal Â·structure of feedback processes and the restrictions on probability
  distributions those structures imply. Developments in our understanding of DCGs
  have proceeded so rapidly that it is appropriate to consider the prospects and limitations
  of cyclic representations of feedback systems. (For an alternative approach to extending
  graphical models to the temporal domain see Aliferis and Cooper, 1996)'
