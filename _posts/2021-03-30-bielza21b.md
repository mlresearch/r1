title: A Comparison of Decision Trees, Influence Diagrams and Valuation Networks for
  Asymmetric Decision Problems
abstract: We compare three graphical techniques for representation and solution of
  asymmetric decision problems- decision trees, influence diagrams, and valuation
  networks. We solve a modified version of Covaliu and Oliverâ€™s Reactor problem using
  each of the three techniques. For each technique, we highlight the strengths, intrinsic
  weaknesses, and shortcomings that perhaps can be overcome by further research.
