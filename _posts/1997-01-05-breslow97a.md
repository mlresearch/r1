title: Comparing Tree-Simplification Procedures
abstract: Induced decision trees are frequently used by researchers in the machine
  learning and statistics communities to solve classification tasks (Breiman et al.
  1984; Quinlan 1993). However, their practical utility is limited by difficulties
  users have in comprehending them due to their size and complexity. Many methods
  have been proposed to simplify decision trees, but their relative capabilities are
  largely unknown; their evaluation is usually limited to comparisons with "bench-mark"
  systems (e.g., C4.5, CART). This paper presents a categoriZation framework for tree-simplification
  methods and focuses on the empirical comparison of selected methods.
