title: Case-based Probability Factoring in Bayesian Belief Networks
abstract: Bayesian network inference can be formulated as a combinatorial optimization
  problem, concerning in the computation of an optimal factoring for the distribution
  represented in the net. Since the determination of an optimal factoring is a computationally
  hard problem, heuristic greedy strategies able to find approximations of the optimal
  factoring are usually adopted. In the present paper we investigate an alternative
  approach based on a combination of genetic algorithms (GA) and case-based reasoning
  (CBR). We show how the use of genetic algorithms can improve the quality of the
  computed factoring in case a static strategy is used (as for the MPE computation),
  while the combination of GA and CBR can still provide advantages in the case of
  dynamic strategies. Some preliminary results on different kinds of nets are then
  reported.
