title: Markov chain Monte Carlo methods for decision analysis
abstract: This paper considers an aspect of mixture modelling. Previous studies have
  shown minimum message length (MML) estimation to perform well in a wide variety
  of mixture modelling problems, including determining the number of components which
  best describes some data. In this paper, we focus on the difficult problem of overlapping
  components. An advantage of the probabilistic mixture modelling approach is its
  ability to identify models where the components overlap and data items can belong
  probabilistically to more than one component. Significantly overlapping distributions
  require more data for their parameters to be accurately estimated than well separated
  distributions. For example, two Gaussian distributions are considered to significantly
  overlap when their means are within three standard deviations of each other. If
  insufficient data is available, only a single component distribution will be estimated,
  although the data originates from two component distributions. In this paper, we
  quantify this difficulty in terms of the number of data items needed for the MML
  criterion to ’discover’ two overlapping components. First, we perform experiments
  which compare the MML criterion’s performance relative to other Bayesian criteria
  based on MCMC sampling. Second, we make two alterations to the existing MML estimates
  in order to improve its performance on overlapping distributions. Experiments are
  performed with the new estimates to confirm that they are effective.
