title: Wavelet based Random Densities
abstract: 'In this paper we describe theoretical properties of wavelet-based random
  densities and give algorithms for their generation. We exhibit random densities
  subject to some standard constraints: smoothness, modality, and skewness. We also
  give a relevant example of use of random densities.'
