title: A Variational Approach to Bayesian Logistic Regression Models and their Extensions
abstract: We consider a logistic regression model with a Gaussian prior distribution
  over the parameters. We show that accurate variational techniques can be used to
  obtain a closed form posterior distribution over the parameters given the data thereby
  yielding a posterior predictive model. The results are readily extended to (binary)
  belief networks. For belief networks we also derive closed form posteriors in the
  presence of missing values. Finally, we show that the dual of the regression problem
  gives a latent variable density model, the variational formulation of which leads
  to exactly solvable EM updates.
