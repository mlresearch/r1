title: A Bayesian approach to CART
abstract: A Bayesian approach for finding classification and regression tree (CART)
  models is proposed. By putting an appropriate prior distribution on the space of
  CART models, the resulting posterior will put higher probability on the more "promising
  trees". In particular, priors are proposed which penalize complexity by putting
  higher probability on trees with fewer nodes. Metropolis-Hastings algorithms are
  used to rapidly grow trees in such a way that the high posterior probability trees
  are more likely to be obtained. In effect, the algorithm performs a stochastic search
  for promising trees. Examples are used to illustrate the potential superiority of
  this approach over conventional greedy methods.
