title: Approximate Inference and Forecast Algorithms in Graphical Models for Partially
  Observed Dynamic Systems
abstract: From a statistical point of view , modelling stochastic temporal processes
  by graphical models is a suitable choice, specially when certain standard assumptions
  in classical modelling cannot be assumed. Focusing the discussion on partially observed
  domains, it is important to design algorithms which provide probability distributions
  over the current and future states of the non-observable components of the domain,
  using the information stored in the observable components. In this paper, we present
  a simulation algorithm for approximating the exact probability distributions associated
  with such inference and forecast processes. This algorithm uses both the probabilities
  built at the previous time step and the new evidence obtained to propose new probability
  distributions associated with current and future states of the domain. To validate
  the algorithm, a case study of equipment maintenance is considered.
