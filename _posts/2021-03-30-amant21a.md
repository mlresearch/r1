title: 'Building an EDA Assistant: A Progress Report'
abstract: Since 1993 we have been working on a system to help people with exploratory
  data analysis (EDA). AIDE, an Assistant for Intelligent Data Exploration, is a knowledge-based
  planning system that incrementally explores a dataset, guided by user directives
  and its own evaluation of indications in the data. Its plan library contains strategies
  for generating and interpreting indications in data, selecting techniques to build
  appropriate descriptions of data, carrying out relevant procedures, and combining
  individual results into a coherent larger picture. The system is mixed-initiative,
  autonomously pursuing high- and low-level goals while still allowing the user to
  inform or override its decisions. Elsewhere we have described AIDEâ€™s operations
  and primitive data structures [22], its planning representation [23], its user interface
  [25, 24], and the system as a whole [21]. This progress report discusses a recent
  evaluation we conducted with AIDE and explains why we believe that this line of
  research is important to AI and statistics researchers. We will begin with a very
  brief overview of the system. The bulk of the paper describes the evaluation, our
  analysis of the results, and the lessons we learned through the experience of building
  and evaluating AIDE. We end with a discussion of the generality of our results and
  the potential for future work.
