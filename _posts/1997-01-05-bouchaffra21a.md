title: 'Integrating Signal and Language Context to Improve Handwritten Phrase Recognition:
  Alternative Approaches'
abstract: Handwritten phrase recognition is an important and difficult task. Recent
  research in this area has fo- cussed on utilising language context to improve recognition
  performance, without taking the information from the input signal itself into proper
  account. In this paper, we adopt a Bayesian approach to solving this problem. The
  Bayesian framework allows us to integrate signal-level information from the actual
  input with the linguistic context usually used in post-processing the recogniserâ€™s
  output. We demonstrate the validity of a statistical approach to integrating these
  two sources of information. We also analyse the need for improvement in performance
  through innovative estimation of informative priors, and describe our method for
  obtaining agreement from multiple experts for this task. We compare the performance
  of our integrated signal-language model against existing "language-only" models.
