title: Cross-validated Likelihood for Model Selection in Unsupervised Learning
abstract: Cross-validation is a well-known technique in supervised learning to select
  a model from a family of candidate models. Examples include selecting the best classification
  tree using cross-validated classification error (Breiman et al., 1984) and variable
  selection in linear regression using cross-validated predictive squared error (Hjort,
  1995). Cross-validation is less seldomly used in \emph{unsupervised} learning such
  as clustering. It is popular in kernel density estimation for choosing the smoothing
  parameter (the kernel bandwidth). However, it does not appear to have been used
  for the problem of determining cluster structure in clustering problems, i.e., solving
  the problem of how many clusters to fit to a given data set. This is the problem
  addressed in this paper. Cross-validated likelihood can be viewed as an appropriate
  metric for model selection in probabilistic clustering, in particular for finite
  mixture models. In this paper, the use of cross-validated likelihood for clustering
  is investigated a.nd the method is applied to a real problem where "truth" is unknown,
  i.e., determining the number of intrinsic "regimes" in records of upper atmosphere
  pressure taken daily since 1948 over the Northern Hemisphere.
