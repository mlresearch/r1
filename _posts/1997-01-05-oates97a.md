title: A Family of Algorithms for Finding Temporal Structure in Data
abstract: Finding patterns in temporally structured data is an important and difficult
  problem. Examples of temporally structured data include time series of economic
  indicators, distributed network status reports, and continuous streams such as flight
  recorder data. We have developed a family of algorithms for finding structure in
  multivariate, discrete-valued time series data (Oates & Cohen 1996b; Oates, Schmill,
  & Cohen 1996; Oates et al. 1995). In this paper, we introduce a new member of that
  family for handling event-based data, and offer an empirical characterization of
  a time series based algorithm.
