title: Graphical Model Based Computer Adaptive Testing
abstract: 'This paper synthesizes ideas from the fields of graphical modelling and
  eductational testing, particularly Item Response Theory (IRT) applied to Computerized
  Adaptive Testing (CAT). Graphical modelling can offer IRT a language for describing
  multifaceted skills and knowledge and disentangling evidence from com- plex performances.
  IRT-CA T can offer graphical modellers several ways of treating sources of variability
  other than including more variables in the model. In particular, variables can enter
  into the modelling pro- cess at several levels: (1) in validity studies (but not
  in the ordinarily used model), (2) in task construction (in particular, in defining
  link parameters), (3) in test or model assembly (blocking and randomization con-
  straints in selecting tasks or other model pieces), (4) in response characterization
  (i.e. as part of task models which characterize a response) or (5) in the main (student)
  model. The paper describes an implementation of these ideas in a fielded application:
