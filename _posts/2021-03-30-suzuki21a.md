title: On the Error Probability of Model Selection for Classification
abstract: 'We consider model selection based on information criteria for classification.
  The information criterion is expressed in the form of the empirical entropy plus
  a compensation term $(k(g)/2)d(n)$, where $k(g)$ is the number of independent parameters
  in a model $g$, $d(n)$ is a function of $n$, and $n$ is the number of examples.
  First of all, we derive for arbitrary $d(\cdot)$ the asymptotically exact error
  probabilities in model selection. Although it was known for linear/autoregression
  processes that $d(n) = \log \log n$ is the minimum function of n such that the model
  selection satisfies strong consistency, the problem whether the same thing holds
  for classification has been open. We solve this problem affirmatively. Additionally,
  we derive for arbitrary $d(\cdot)$ the expected Kullback-leibler divergence between
  a true conditional probability and the conditional probability estimated by the
  model selection and the Laplace estimators. The derived value is $k(g^*)/(2n)$,
  where $g^*$ is a true model, and the accumulated value over $n$ time instances is
  $(k(g*)/2) \log n + 0(1)$, which implies the optimality of a predictive coding based
  on the model selection. Keywords: model selection, error probability, strong con-
  sistency, Kullback-Leibler divergence, minimum description length principle, Hannan/Quinn’s
  procedure, unseparated/separated models, Kolmogorov’s law of the iterated logarithm.'
