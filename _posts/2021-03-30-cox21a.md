title: Using classification trees to improve causal inferences in observational studies
abstract: Much of the recent literature on AI and statistics has focused on how to
  use causal knowledge to enrich the set of valid causal inferences that can be drawn
  from available data and applied to practical problems such as decision-making, probabilistic
  diagnosis, and cost-effective control of systems. This paper examines classical
  problems of valid causal inference in observational studies, using epidemiological
  studies on the association between exposure to diesel exhaust (DE) and risk of lung
  cancer as a case study. It shows that one of the main applied computational tools
  of AI and statistics, classification tree analysis, can be adapted to help control
  or avoid many of the usual statistical threats to valid causal inference, and links
  this new use of classification trees to an established older literature on techniques
  for causal inference in social statistics based on elimination of competing (non-causal)
  explanations for observed associations. A strong link is then forged between an
  extension of classification tree analysis and modem AI and statistics approaches
  to causal modeling and inference based in directed acyclic graph (DAG) causal models
  and influence diagrams. This new link is based on the observation that classification
  tree analysis can be adapted to test the local Markov conditions that provide the
  critical defining structure of DAG models, as well as to quantify the conditional
  distributions of variables given the values of their parents - the key numerical
  information needed to quantify an influence diagram model. Finally, these insights
  are applied to available data on DE and lung cancer risks and are used to conclude
  that there is no evidence of a causal relation between them.
