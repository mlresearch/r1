title: Bayesian Model Averaging in Rule Induction
abstract: Bayesian model averaging (BMA) can be seen as the optimal approach to any
  induction task. It can reduce error by accounting for model uncertainty in a principled
  way, and its usefulness in several areas has been empirically verified. However,
  few attempts to apply it to rule induction have been made. This paper reports a
  series of experiments designed to test the utility of BMA in this field. BMA is
  applied to combining multiple rule sets learned from different subsets of the training
  data, to combining multiple rules covering a test example, to inducing technical
  rules for foreign exchange trading, and to inducing conjunctive concepts. In the
  first two cases, BMA is observed to produce lower accuracies than the ad hoc methods
  it is compared with. In the last two cases, BMA is observed to typically produce
  the same result as simply using the best (maximum-likelihood) rule, even though
  averaging is performed over all possible rules in the space, the domains are highly
  noisy, and the samples are medium- to small-sized. In all cases, this is observed
  to be due to BMAâ€™s consistent tendency to assign highly asymmetric weights to different
  models, even when their accuracy differs by little, with most models (often all
  but one) effectively having no influence on the outcome. Thus the effective number
  of models being averaged is much smaller for BMA than for common ad hoc methods,
  leading to a smaller reduction in variance. This suggests that the success of the
  multiple models approach to rule induction is primarily due to this variance reduction,
  and not to its being a closer approximation to the Bayesian ideal.
