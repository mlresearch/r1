title: An Algorithm for Bayesian Network Construction from Data
abstract: This paper presents an efficient algorithm for constructing Bayesian belief
  networks from databases. The algorithm takes a database and an attributes ordering
  (i.e., the causal attributes of an attribute should appear earlier in the order)
  as input and constructs a belief network structure as output. The construction process
  is based on the computation of mutual information and cross entropy of attribute
  pairs. This algorithm guarantees that the \emph{minimal Independent map} [1] of
  the underlying dependency model is generated, and at the same time, enjoys the time
  complexity of $O(N^2)$ on conditional independence (Cl) tests. To evaluate this
  algorithm, we present the experimental results on three versions of the well-known
  ALARM network database, which has 37 attributes and 10,000 records. The correctness
  proof and the analysis of computational complexity are also presented. We also discuss
  the features ofour work and relate it to previous works.
