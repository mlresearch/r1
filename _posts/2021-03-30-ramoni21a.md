title: Robust Parameter Learning in Bayesian Networks with Missing Data
abstract: 'Bayesian Belief Networks (BBNs) are a powerful formalism for knowledge
  representation and reasoning under uncertainty. During the past few years, Artificial
  Intelligence metÂ·Statistics in the quest to develop effective methods to learn BBNs
  directly from databases. Unfortunately, real-world databases include missing and/or
  unreported data whose presence challenges traditional learning techniques, from
  both the theoretical and computational point of view. This paper introduces a new
  method to learn the probabilities defining a BBNs from databases with missing data.
  The intuition behind this method is close to the robust sensitivity analysis interpretation
  of probability: the method computes the extreme points of the set of possible distributions
  consistent with the available information and proceeds by refining this set as more
  information becomes available. This paper outlines the description of this method
  and presents some experimental results comparing this approach to the Gibbs Samplings.'
