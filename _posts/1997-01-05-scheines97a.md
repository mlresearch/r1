title: 'Estimating Latent Causal Inferences: Tetrad II model selection and Bayesian
  parameter estimation'
abstract: The statistical evidence for the detrimental effect of low level lead exposure
  on the cognitive capacities of children has been debated for several decades. In
  this paper I describe how two techniques from artificial intelligence and statistics
  proved crucial in making the statistical evidence for the accepted epidemiological
  conclusion seem decisive. The first is a variable-selection routine in TETRAD II,
  and the second a Bayesian estimation of the parameter reflecting the causal influence
  of Actual Lead Exposure, a latent variable, on the measured IQ score of middle class
  suburban children.
