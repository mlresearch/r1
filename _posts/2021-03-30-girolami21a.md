title: 'Multivariate Density Factorization for Independent Component Analysis: An
  Unsupervised Artificial Neural Network Approach'
abstract: We propose a novel homogenous nonlinear self-organising network which employs
  solely computationally simple hebbian and anti-hebbian learning, in approximating
  a linear independent component analysis (ICA). The learning algorithms diagonalise
  the transformed data covariance matrix and approximate an orthogonal rotation which
  maximises the sum offourth order cumulants. This provides factorisation of the input
  multivariate density into the individual independent latent marginal densities.
  We apply this network to linear mixtures of data, which are inherently non-gaussian
  and have both Laplacian and bi-modal probability densities. We show that the proposed
  network is capable of factorising multivariate densities which are linear mixtures
  of independent latent playkurtic, leptokurtic and uniform distributions.
