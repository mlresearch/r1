title: Using Prediction to Improve Combinatorial Optimization Search
abstract: This paper describes a statistical approach to improving the performance
  of stochastic search algorithms for optimization. Given a search algorithm $A$,
  we learn to predict the outcome of $A$ as a function of state features along a search
  trajectory. Predictions are made by a function approximator such as global or locally-weighted
  polynomial regression; training data is collected by Monte-Carlo simulation. Extrapolating
  from this data produces a new evaluation function which can bias future search trajectories
  toward better optima. Our implementation of this idea, STAGE, has produced very
  promising results on two large-scale domains.
