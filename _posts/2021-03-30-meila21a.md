title: An Objective Function for Belief Net Triangulation
abstract: This paper presents a new approach to the triangulation of belief networks.
  Triangulation is a combinatorial optimization problem; our idea is to embed its
  discrete domain into a continuous domain e. Then, by suitably extending the objective
  function over e, we can make use of continuous optimization techniques to do the
  minimization. We used an upper bound of the total junction tree weight as the cost
  function. The appropriateness of this choice is discussed and explored by simulations.
