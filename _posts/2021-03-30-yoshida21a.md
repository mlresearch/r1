title: 'WWW Cache Layout to Ease Network Overload.........................................................................................537 '
abstract: The GBI (graph-based induction) concept learning method is applied to extract
  typical access patterns of WWW data. By interpreting extracted patterns as the cache
  site layout we can reduce the total network data flow by implementing a distributed
  cache system which is adapted to the WWW access patterns. Although the huge WWW
  data flow causes the overflow of the conventional hierarchical cache system, the
  layout created by the GBI method eases this problem. The traffic reduction ratio
  of this distributed cache system is 2.5 times higher than that of the conventional
  hierarchical cache system. Our results suggest the importance of the data analyzing
  methods which can handle structured data. By analyzing regularity in graph structures,
  the GBI method can reduce the network data flow; The statistical criteria contribute
  to the analysis of promising patterns
