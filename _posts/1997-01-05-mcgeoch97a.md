title: How to Find Big-Oh in Your Data Set (and How Not To)
abstract: The \emph{empirical curve bounding problem} is defined as follows. Suppose
  data vectors $X$, $Y$ are presented such that $E(Y[i]) = \bar{f}(X[i])$ where $\bar{f}(x)$
  is an unknown function. The problem is to analyze $X$, $Y$ and obtain complexity
  bounds $O(g_u(x))$ and $\Omega(g_l(x))$ on the function $\bar{f}(x)$. As no algorithm
  for empirical curve bounding can be guaranteed correct, we consider heuristics.
  Five heuristic algorithms are presented here, together with analytical results guaranteeing
  correctness for certain families of functions. Experimental evaluations of the correctness
  and tightness of bounds obtained by the rules for several constructed functions
  $f(x)$ and real datasets are described.
