title: PAC Learning with Constant-Partition Classification Noise and Applications
  to Decision Tree Induction
abstract: We consider the problem of concept learning in Valiantâ€™s PAC learning model
  in which the data used for learning is noisy. Specifically, we introduce a new model
  of noise called \emph{constant-partition classification noise} (CPCN) which generalizes
  the standard model of classification noise to allow different examples to have different
  rates of random misclassification. One example of CPCN type noise is data with differing
  rates of false positives and false negatives. We then show how to learn in the presense
  of CPCN for any concept class learnable by statistical queries. This set of classes
  includes every concept class known to be learnable in the presense of standard classification
  noise. Our model is the first such non-uniform generalization of the standard classification
  noise model that allows efficient learning of this wide range of concept classes.
  We then examine standard methods of decision tree induction in the context of noisy
  data. We observe that the core of commonly used algorithms such as ID3, CART and
  c4.5 are not robust to CPCN noise, or even to standard classification noise. We
  therefore propose a simple modification to these algorithms in order to make them
  robust against CPCN. The modification is based on the statistical query techniques
  for CPCN described above.
