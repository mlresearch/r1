title: 'Intelligent Assistant for Computational Scientists: Integrated Modelling,
  Experimentation and Analysis'
abstract: 'Computing technology has changed the way scientists work. Among the contributions
  of this new paradigm are the computational sciences, which involve the study of
  computer simulations rather than physical systems. This transition to a simulated
  world carries with it an important scientific advantage: the opportunity to run
  experiments that are expensive, dangerous, or impossible in the real world. Unfortunately,
  such experiments are often too easy, and the scientist is overwhelmed with empirical
  data. The fields of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Statistics are concerned with
  modelling and analyzing such large bodies of data. AI employs heuristic reasoning
  and knowledge to select potential models, and statistical analysis verifies a proposed
  model. The combinatio  of knowledge-based, heuristic, and statistical techniques
  is quite successful at modelling experiment data (e.g. [11]). Our goal is to provide
  an intelligent, integrated environment for scientific modelling, experimentation
  , and analysis, called the Scientist ’s Empirical Assistant (SEA). SEA is an assistant
  to human scientists: it automates model generation and verification, experiment
  design and data collection, but also relies on a human user for guidance, domain
  knowledge, and decision-making. SEA designs and runs prospective experiments with
  a simulator, allowing it to draw stronger conclusions than with post-hoc data analysis
  alone. SEA employs a variety of techniques from both AI and Statistics. It uses
  heuristic and knowledge-based reasoning to propose models, design experiments, and
  select analyses. It applies statistical techniques to verify models against experiment
  data. It develops plans to direct its course of action, and learns which plans are
  most successful based on past experience. Finally, it models the knowledge of the
  user to ensure its suggestions and decisions are appropriate.'
