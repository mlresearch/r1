title: On Predictive Classification of Binary Vectors
abstract: The problem of rational classification of a database of binary vectors is
  analyzed by means of a family of Bayesian predictive distributions on the binary
  hypercube. The general notion of predictive classification was probably first discussed
  by S. Geisser. The predictive distributions are expressed in terms of a finite number
  observables based on a given set of binary vectors (predictors or centroids) representing
  a system of classes and an entropy-maximizing family of probability distributions.
  We derive the (non-probabilistic) criterion of maximal predictive classification
  due to J . Gower (1974) as a special case of a Bayesian predictive classification.
  The notion of a predictive distribution will be related to stochastic complexity
  of a set of data with respect to a family of statistical distributions. An application
  to bacterial identification will be presented using a database of Enterobacteriaceae
  as in Gyllenberg (1996 c). A framework for the analysis is provided by a theorem
  about the merging of opinions due to Blackwell and Dubins (1962). We prove certain
  results about the asymptotic properties of the predictive learning process.
