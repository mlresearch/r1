title: Comparing Predictive Inference Methods for Discrete Domains
abstract: Predictive inference is seen here as the process of determining the predictive
  distribution of a discrete variable, given a data set of training examples and the
  values for the other problem domain variables. We consider three approaches for
  computing this predictive distribution, and assume that the joint probability distribution
  for the variables belongs to a set of distributions determined by a set of parametric
  models. In the simplest case, the predictive distribution is computed by using the
  model with the \emph{maximum a posteriori (MAP)} posterior probability. In the \emph{evidence}
  approach, the predictive distribution is obtained by averaging over all the individual
  models.in the model family. In the third case, we define the predictive distribution
  by using Rissanen’s new definition of \emph{stochastic complexity}. Our experiments
  performed with the family of Naive Bayes models suggest that when using all the
  data available, the stochastic complexity approach produces the most accurate predictions
  in the log-score sense. However, when the amount of available training data is decreased,
  the evidence approach clearly outperforms the two other approaches. The MAP predictive
  distribution is clearly inferior in the log-score sense to the two more sophisticated
  approaches, but for the 0/1-score the MAP approach may still in some cases produce
  the best results.
