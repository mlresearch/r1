title: A Distance Metric for Classification Trees
abstract: 'CART is an unstable classifier resulting in significant changes in tree
  structure for small changes in the learning set (Breiman, Friedman et al. 1984;
  Breiman 1994). To address this problem, research into combining classifiers has
  increased significantly in the last few years (Breiman 1992; Wolpert 1992; Breiman
  1994). These methods are of two basic types: concatenation uses the output from
  one classifier as input to the next classifier; parallel classifiers work on the
  same input data with the output from each classifier combined using regression or
  vote-counting techniques (Schurman 1996). These strategies greatly improve the predictive
  power of unstable classifiers. However, when the goal of the statistical analysis
  is to learn about the relationship between outcome and predictors, these strategies
  for combining classifiers are unacceptable since they produce a large number of
  trees, making interpretation difficult. We present a new method for combining classification
  trees which results in a single, interpretable tree. We begin by defining a distance
  metric between two trees based on the amount of rearrangement needed so that the
  structure of the two trees is identical. Using this distance metric, we develop
  the concept of the central, or median, tree structure and estimate it using a consensus
  rule. This tree is seen to be more centrally located than the tree fit to all the
  data. We finish by discussing future work including alternative methods for estimating
  the median tree, probability models, uses in data mining and meta-analysis, and
  performance measurements of the median tree.'
