title: Strategies for Model Mixing in Generalized Linear Models
abstract: In linear regression models and generalized linear regression models (GLMs),
  there is often substantial uncertainty about the choice of covariates to include
  in the model. Both classical and Bayesian approaches that involve selecting a subset
  of covariates and making inferences conditional on that model choice ignore a major
  component of uncertainty in the problem. One approach for incorporating this form
  of model uncertainty into the analysis is by directly building into the model a
  vector of indicator variables $Y$ that reflects which covariates are included in
  the model ...
