title: Dataset cataloging metadata for machine learning applications research
abstract: 'As the field of machine learning (ML) matures, two types of data archives
  are developing: collections of benchmark data sets used to test the performance
  of new algorithms, and data stores to which machine learning/data mining algorithms
  are applied to create scientific or commercial applications. At present, the catalogs
  of these archives are ad hoc and not tailored to machine learning analysis. This
  paper considers the cataloging metadata required to support these two types of repositories,
  and discusses the organizational support necessary for archive catalog maintenance.'
