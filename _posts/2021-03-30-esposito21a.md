title: Inductive Inference of First-Order Models from Numeric-Symbolic Data
abstract: 'A factor common to statistical techniques of data analysis is the adopted
  representation formalism: A tabular (zeroth-order) model with almost exclusively
  numerical features . On the contrary, several studies on machine learning concern
  the induction of first-order models from symbolic data, but are inadequate for continuous
  data. In the paper, we face the problem of handling both numerical and symbolic
  data in first-order models. distinguishing the moment of model generation from examples
  (induction) from the moment of model recognition by means of a flexible. probabilistic
  subsumption test. We demonstrate the proposed solutions on a problem in document
  understanding where the objective is to induce the models of the logical structure
  of some real business letters.'
