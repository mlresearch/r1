title: Overfitting Explained
abstract: Overfitting arises when model components are evaluated against the wrong
  reference distribution. Most modeling algorithms iteratively find the best of several
  components and then test whether this component is good enough to add to the model.
  We show that for independently distributed random variables, the reference distribution
  for any one variable underestimates the reference distribution for the the highest-valued
  variable; thus variate values will appear significant when they are not, and model
  components will be added when they should not be added. We relate this problem to
  the well-known statistical theory of multiple comparisons or simultaneous inference.
