title: A Characterization of Bayesian Network Structures and its Application to Leaming
abstract: We present an analysis of the minimal I-map relation between Bayesian network
  structures and dependency models. This includes a partial order characterisation
  of the structures, and the connection between the relation and the arc reversal
  operation. Two applications of this analysis are presented. The first is a simple
  condition for identifying equivalence between Bayesian network structures, and the
  second is an exact learning algorithm based on the partial order characterisation.
