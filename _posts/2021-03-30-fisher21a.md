title: Inference using Probabilistic Concept Trees
abstract: Discussions of ’probabilistic reasoning systems’ often presuppose a belief
  network, which represents the joint probability distribution of a domain, as the
  primary knowledge structure. However, another common knowledge structure from which
  the joint probability distribution can be recovered is a hierarchical probabilistic
  clustering or probabilistic concept tree (Fisher, 1987). Probabilistic concept trees
  are a target structure for a number of clustering systems from machine learning
  such as COBWEB (Fisher, 1987) and systems by Hadzikadik and Yun (1989), Gennari,
  Langley, and Fisher (1989), Decaestecker (1991), Anderson and Matessa (1991), Reich
  and Fenves (1991), Biswas, Weinberg, and Li (1994), De Alte Da Veiga (1994), Kilander
  (1994) Ketterlin, Gan{\c}arski, and Korczak (1995), and Nevins (1995). Related probabilistic
  structures are produced by systems such as AUTOCLASS (Cheeseman, Kelly, Self, Stutz,
  Taylor, &Freeman, 1988), SNOB (Wallace &Boulton, 1968; Wallace & Dowe, 1994) , and
  systems by Hanson and Bauer (1989) and Martin and Billman (1994). These systems
  can be easily adapted to form probabilistic concept trees of the type we describe.
  This paper will not focus on clustering systems \emph{per se}, but on characteristics
  and capabilities of probabilistic concept trees, particularly as they relate to
  inference tasks often associated with belief networks. As ’object-centered’ knowledge
  structures, probabilistic concept trees nicely complement the ’variable-centered’,
  belief network structure.
