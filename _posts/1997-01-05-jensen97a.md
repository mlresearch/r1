title: Adjusting for Multiple Testing in Decision Tree Pruning
abstract: Overfitting is a widely observed pathology of induction algorithms. Overfitted
  models contain unnecessary structure that reflects nothing more than random variation
  in the data sample used to construct the model. Portions of these models are literally
  wrong, and can mislead users. Overfitted models are less efficient to store and
  use than their correctly-sized counterparts. Finally, overfitting can reduce the
  accuracy of induced models on new data [14, 7]. For induction algorithms that build
  decision trees [1, 13, 15], pruning is a common approach to correct overfitting.
  Pruning techniques take an induced tree, examine individual subtrees, and remove
  those subtrees deemed to be unnecessary. While pruning techniques can differ in
  several respects, they primarily differ in the criterion used to judge subtrees.
  Many criteria have been proposed, including statistical significance tests [13],
  corrected error estimates [15], and minimum description length calculations [12].
  Most common pruning techniques, however, do not account for one potentially important
  factor - multiple testing. Multiple testing occurs whenever an induction algorithm
  examines several candidate models and selects the one that best accords with the
  data. Any search process necessarily involves multiple testing, and most common
  induction algorithms involve implicit or explicit search through a space of candidate
  models. In the case of decision trees, search involves examining many possible subtrees
  and selecting the best one. Pruning techniques need to account for the number of
  subtrees examined, because such multiple testing affects the apparent accuracy of
  models on training data [8]. This paper examines the importance of adjusting for
  multiple testing. Specifically, it examines the effectiveness of one particular
  pruning method - \emph{bonferroni pruning}. Bonferroni pruning adjusts the results
  of a standard significance test to account for the number of subtrees examined at
  a particular node of a decision tree. Evidence that bonferroni pruning leads to
  better models supports the hypothesis that multiple testing is an important cause
  of overfitting.
